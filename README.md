# Rolling America Dice Simulator

The live demo is available at http://radice.jdkilby.com.

I built this dice simulator so I can play the game Rolling America without the dice. Using this tool, all one needs are scoresheets and a writing utensil. This makes it perfect for places where rolling dice is inconvenient (like on an airplane) or might be too loud (like a public library). It's also great if you just want to throw the game pads in the bag if storage is really limited.

*Want more information about the game? Or want to know where it or extra scoresheets can be purchased? Check out the [Rolling America website](http://gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&page=game&show=315). I highly recommend this game for those who like puzzles. It's fast, portable (especially with this dice simulator), and cheap (less than $15 USD at game stores and - as of writing this - Target stores).*

Usage is straightforward: the game's seven dice are randomly rolled, two-at-a-time, until six dice have been rolled. Tap the button at the top (*"Reset Dice"*) to clear the dice and start over.
